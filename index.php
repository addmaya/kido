						<h2>Common Questions</h2>
					</header>
					<section class="o-faq">
						<h3>What is the minimum amount you can start with?</h3>
						<p>Investors can start with as low as USh 300,000. However, we realize everyone’s circumstances are different. You could decide to define a goal (e.g. retirement) and invest a lump sum amount at the beginning. Alternatively, one can start with a modest minimum amount and periodically add to their investment account (e.g. monthly contributions) over the investment horizon.</p>
